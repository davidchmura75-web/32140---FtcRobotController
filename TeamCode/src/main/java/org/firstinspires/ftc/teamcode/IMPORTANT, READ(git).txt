HEY GUYS
Your favorite programmer from the very real state of CT, David Chmura, here with a git guide
since you guys may want me to look over stuff in the future
OR
code from your PC, you have to use github

that means you gotta do a few things
firstly, you probably have an account
and, you have access to this repository

since you are reading this file in the private repo

next, you need to run git clone in the folder you want this code in inside a terminal
to get there, boot up a terminal and run ```cd {folder}``` until you get there
if you get lost hit a ```dir``` if on windows or an ```ls``` on mac
if you go too far, ```cd ..``` backs you up a step

next go to git, click on code, and copy the https link
then run the command ```git clone {PASTE THINE LINK HERE}```

then the folder magically goes in and you have the code!

TADA!

Lets say you guys are so cool and smart and make a new change
if its a new file, be sure to add it to git when that comes up
if its in a file, it should be good

When you are done for the day or want to push, go to the icon with the circle and line through it, on the left sidebar it says commit
Then what you do is you check off the file you want to send(all of them) and then put a message telling me(the coolest programmer on earth ofc)
or past you what happened

then run "COMMIT AND PUSH"

At the beginning of every night though, be sure to go to the folder in a terminal with the cd, read that if you forgot
run a ```git pull``` once inside that folder
that way code done at home or at connecticut by the greatest programmer ever gets pulled to your laptop
Thats like off camera mining except with code, Wow!
SO COOL!

And just like that, you are a git wizard, go get em champs
I expect a new push after every meeting!!!
